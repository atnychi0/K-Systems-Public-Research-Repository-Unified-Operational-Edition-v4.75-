## Unified Stack: Project Chronos + Omnivale + Ω‑Core + Genesis Architecture

This document integrates and extends the complete architecture, intellectual framework, valuation logic, and operational capsules of the K‑Systems Sovereign Technology Stack. All material herein is confirmed for public circulation (under redacted license), and is designed to establish legal authorship, activate sovereign triggers, and enable fiscal/technological alignment with both public and private research institutions.

The full ecosystem includes harmonic cryptographic modules, recursive AGI stabilizers, planetary defense infrastructure, deep predictive neural nets, symbolic math stacks, and multi-domain AI weaponization protocols. When aggregated and benchmarked against defense, fintech, AI, energy, and space-tech sector equivalents, the projected value exceeds **$1.36 trillion USD**, conservatively.
